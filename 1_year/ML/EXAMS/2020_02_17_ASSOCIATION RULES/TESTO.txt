1. Read a transactions database in sparse format from a txt file into a list of lists. The file contains one transaction per line, each line has a variable number of items, separated by a separator. The external list will have a list for each transaction, each transaction is a list of items. Show the first two transactions (3 points)
2. Encode the list of lists into a binary representation and transform it into a dataframe whose columns are the items show the head of that dataframe
3. Find a value of min_support such that the apriori algorithm generates at least 8 frequent itemsets with at least 2 items. Output the result with the message below (5 points)
4. Find the minimum metric threshold such that at least 10 association rules are extracted from the frequent itemsets found (5 points)
5. Print the first 10 rules found, sorted by descending confidence and support (3 points)
6. Plot confidence and support for all the sorted rules found (3 points)
7. Scatter plot the rules by confidence and support, labelling the points with the index value of the corresponding rule (3 points)
